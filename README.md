# c-sharp-language-parser

This is C# lexical analyzer. It is planned to improve it by implementation of syntax and semantics analysis.

Tokens reading is implemented by use of regular expressions. Directive "#if" is implemented using grammar (which is quite slow so I will
change such a way of things later).

The analyzer is made as homework during NTUU "KPI"'s "Programming Automatization Systems" course.
